# Linked List

`Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.`

## Types of linked lists:

### There are mainly three types of linked lists:

- Single-linked list: `In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence.`
- Double linked list: `In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes.`
- Circular linked list: `In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the head node, creating a circular structure.`
